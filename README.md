Travis CLI Test

This project demonstrates the steps required to install and run Travis CLI commands from within a Travis build.

Includes install commands for public www.travis-ci.org and enterprise Travis (commented-out).

To prove it works, the script issues commands to:
 - Display the user's list of github repos,
 - Set a public environment variable into the Travis project settings.
